This information is for educational purposes and is not a investment recommendation nor to be representative of professional expertise. All examples and analysis used herein are for illustration purposes only. All examples and analysis are intended for these purposes and should not be considered as specific investment advice. The risk of loss in trading securities, options, futures, and forex can be substantial. Customers must consider all relevant risk factors including their own personal financial situation before trading. Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. We, CMidas Financial, are not responsible for any trades readers post with their brokers, claiming us as an authority on their decisions. Individuals are solely responsible for any live trades placed in their own personal accounts. CMidas Financial is in no way responsible for individual loss due to poor trading decisions, poorly executed trades, or any other individual actions which may lead to loss of funds. CMidas Financial is not an investment advisory service, nor a registered investment adviser or broker-dealer and does not purport to tell or suggest which securities customers should buy or sell for themselves. The analysts and employees or affiliates of CMidas Financial may hold positions in the stocks or industries discussed here. You understand and acknowledge that there is a very high degree of risk involved in trading securities. CMidas Financial the authors, the publisher, and all affiliates of CMidas Financial assume no responsibility or liability for your trading and investment results. Factual statements on CMidas Financial’s website and newsletter, or in its publications, are made as of the date stated and are subject to change without notice. It should not be assumed that the methods, techniques, or indicators presented in these subscription services, website, and newsletter will be profitable or that they will not result in losses. Past results of any individual trader or trading system published by CMidas Financial are not indicative of future returns by that trader or system, and are not indicative of future returns which be realized by you. In addition, the indicators, strategies, columns, articles and all other features of CMidas Financial’s products (collectively, the “Information”) are provided for informational and educational purposes only and should not be construed as investment advice. Examples presented on CMidas Financial’s website and newsletter are for educational purposes only. Such set-ups are not solicitations of any order to buy or sell. Accordingly, you should not rely solely on the Information in making any investment. Rather, you should use the Information only as a starting point for doing additional independent research in order to allow you to form your own opinion regarding investments. You should always check with your licensed financial advisor and tax advisor to determine the suitability of any investment.</p>

            <h3>Important Notices About Trading</h3>
            <p>CMidas Financial, LLC and its personnel are not registered broker-dealers or investment advisers. You are encouraged to speak with licensed broker-dealers, investment advisers or counselors of your choice regarding the appropriateness of investing or of any particular investment strategy or security. CMidas Financial subscription services, website, and newsletter are for informational and educational purposes only, and no mention of a particular security in any CMidas Financial subscription services, website, and newsletter constitutes a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold that or any other security, or that any particular security, portfolio of securities, transaction or investment strategy is suitable for any specific person. None of the information providers (e.g., instructors or sales persons or customer service representatives) or their affiliates will advise you personally concerning the nature, potential, value or suitability of any particular security, portfolio of securities, transaction, investment strategy or other matter. To the extent any of the information contained in any CMidas Financial subscription services, website, and newsletter may be deemed to be investment advice, it is impersonal and not tailored to the individual investment needs of any specific person. CMidas Financial personnel are not subject to trading restrictions. CMidas Financial personnel could have a position in a security or initiate a position in a security at any time. In the event you enter into trading transactions, CMidas Financial personnel also may be trading or have positions in the same securities. CMidas Financial subscription services, website, and newsletter contain opinions about securities, and the opinions differ. For example, an opinion about a security in a certain CMidas Financial publication could differ from an opinion about the same security that is in another CMidas Financial publication. All investments and trading involve risk. Trading and investing subjects you to risk of losses, including losses greater than your original investment. Many strategies, investments and securities (including options) are not suitable for everyone. CMidas Financial does not determine whether any strategy, investment or security is suitable for any individual. Particularly with respect to options, prior to buying or selling an option, an investor must receive a copy of Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options, called the Options Disclosure Document (ODD). This document is available from your broker-dealer. No one should trade with money they cannot afford to lose. As such CMidas Financial directs all participants to practice trading with virtual, or fake funds. CMidas Financial in no way encourages individuals to place real money on any particular trade. Such decisions and any transaction related to such decision is at the sole discretion of the individual placing the trade.  Where hypothetical or simulated examples are provided, because they do not represent actual trading, they have limitations. They are designed with hindsight and thus, can be biased to select favorable performance results. Also, since the trades have not been executed, the results may have under or over compensated for certain factors such as the lack of market liquidity. Examples of trades and investment strategies do not include the costs of commissions, interest and dividends and other expenses. Keep in mind that these costs affect whether an investment is profitable.</p>
